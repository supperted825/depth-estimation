# Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

Monocular depth estimation using a residual UNet with the [NYU Depth V2 Dataset](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html).

The objective function is a combination of the smoothness loss, structural similarity (SSIM) loss, and L1 loss between the produced depth map and the truth depth map.

This project was complted as part of Red Dragon AI's Advanced Computer Vision course.
